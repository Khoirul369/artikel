<p><font size="2"><strong>ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2">We may assign this BULA in whole or in part. In the event of a merger, acquisition, sale or corporate transaction involving Us or Our affiliates or subsidiaries, Your continued use of the Software signifies Your agreement to be bound by the agreements and policies of the subsequent owner, if any. You may not assign any Subscription License, or any Perpetual License (except as set out under this Section) at any time. Subject to the restrictions in this Section, You may assign only fully-paid Perpetual Licenses for which You have acquired additional paid Support Services beyond the free support set forth in this BULA, and such assignment is made in connection with the transfer of hardware or employees to whom licensed copies of the Software have been assigned as part of (a) Your sale, merger, reorganization or privatization; or (b) a consolidation involving You. Upon such transfer, You must immediately uninstall the Software from all devices under Your control or possession and discontinue using the transferred licensed copies. You must notify Us of a transfer of a Perpetual License prior to such transfer by completing and sending Us a license transfer form, which can be obtained directly from Us. No transfer of any license will be valid unless the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this BULA with respect to the Software for which the licenses are being transferred. You must provide Us proof of the transferee’s written agreement for Our records along with the transfer notice form prior to any transfer. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">If You obtained Your Perpetual License to the Software in a Member State of the European Union or the European Economic Area, and Your place of business is in a Member State of the European Union or the European Economic Area, then the limitations in this section pertaining to the transfer of such a Perpetual Software License shall not apply to You. In such a case, You may sell or resell the original copy of the Software in Your possession or under Your control subject to the following conditions: </font></p>
<p><font size="2">1. The Software was lawfully placed on the marked within the EEA by Us or with Our consent. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">2. If You resell Your Perpetual License and transfer the original copy of the Software to the new buyer, You must destroy and make each individual copy of the Software You ever had useless. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">3. You must provide the new buyer with the information necessary to determine the extent of proper use. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Should You not be the lawful first buyer of the Perpetual License for the Software, You are only entitled to use the Software if You lawfully acquired the original copy in accordance with this BULA. As a lawful subsequent buyer of a Perpetual License, Your rights to use the Software are at all times defined and restricted by the terms and conditions of this BULA. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Any transfer not made in compliance with this section will be void. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>COMPATIBILITY </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Some Software versions may not be compatible with various computer operating systems and We may not release Updates establishing compatibility. The Software may not be compatible with computer operating systems that You may purchase now or in the future. You understand that Software may be incorporated into, and may incorporate itself into, software and other technology owned and controlled by third parties. This BULA remains effective with such incorporation. All third-party software or technology that may be distributed together with the Software as bundled third-party software may be subject to You explicitly accepting a license agreement with that third party. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>EVALUATION SOFTWARE </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2">If the Software is identified as a demonstration, evaluation or trial version in the applicable Documentation You may install and access the Software only for the purpose of evaluation and/or demonstration. Unless We have authorized You to do so, You may not use Our Software for competitive analysis or commercial, professional, or other for-profit purposes. You understand that at the end of the evaluation period, You must either stop using the Software or pay for a license to continue using it. If You fail to pay, then upon expiration of the evaluation period, You will no longer be authorized to use the Software and You must immediately discontinue use of the Software and delete and destroy all electronic copies of the Software including but not limited to all user Documentation that may have been provided as part of the evaluation, from Your computer and any other computer devices on which You have installed the Software. Any attempt to circumvent any expiration date technology is in violation of this BULA and will automatically and immediately terminate Your license to use the Software. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>FORCE MAJEURE </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2">We shall not be liable for any failure to perform Our obligations if such failure is a result of an event outside Our reasonable control. In such case We will use reasonable efforts to mitigate the effect of any such event. If such event continues for more than one (1) calendar month, either party may terminate this BULA with respect to services not yet performed or products not yet provided upon written notice. Upon such termination, You must immediately pay Us any outstanding amounts owed. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Our affiliates and licensors shall be a direct and intended third party beneficiary of this BULA. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2">You must keep records relating to all use, installation, and deployment of Software throughout Your organization and/or through a Virtualization Environment (as defined in the relevant Software Specific Terms). We have the right, at Our expense, to audit these records to verify Your compliance with this BULA and the scope of license granted to You under the Specific Terms. This audit may be conducted at any time during the terms of Your Subscription Licenses and for two years thereafter and/or the terms of Your Perpetual Licenses and for two years following any termination, but shall not be conducted more than once annually unless an audit reveals unlicensed use. In such case, We may conduct verification as frequently as quarterly for the subsequent annual period. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Our audit and verification process will require You to provide, within thirty (30) days of Our request, (a) raw data of all Software installed or deployed by or at Your direction; (b) all valid purchase documentation for all licensed copies of the Software; and (c) any other information as We may reasonably request. Any verification may include an onsite audit conducted at Your relevant places of business upon thirty (30) days’ prior notice, during regular business hours, which will not unduly interfere with Your business activities. Any information collected in the audit will be used solely for the purposes of determining compliance. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">If the audit and verification shows that You are deploying, installing, or using the Software: (a) beyond the quantity that was licensed; or (b) in any way not permitted under this BULA, so that additional fees apply, You must pay the additional license fees, any applicable maintenance fees, interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and all expenses of recovery, within thirty (30) days after the invoice date. By exercising the rights and procedures described in this section, We do not waive Our rights to enforce this BULA or to protect Our intellectual property by any other means permitted by law. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Our audit and collection of any data and information with respect to Your use, installation, and deployment of Software throughout Your organization shall be subject to the privacy terms specified in Our Privacy Policy. The audit rights set out under this section shall survive for two (2) years past the expiry or termination of the applicable license. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>PRICING, PAYMENT AND RENEWAL </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Our fees for licensing the Software directly from Us in accordance with this BULA and for purchasing any Support Services are available on Our Website and are subject to change at any time or maybe communicated to You by Us or our channel partner (“<strong>Fees</strong>”). Unless You have purchased a license or Support Services through one of Our channel partners, We or Our payments collection agent will charge the Fees to Your payment method and send You a receipt to Your email address. We or our channel partner will also share with You a license certificate that specifies the type of license(s)(Subscription or Perpetual) You have purchased in accordance with Your submitted order, what versions and editions of the Software are being licensed, the term of Your license(s), the number of permitted Users and/or devices on which or from which the Software may be deployed or used, the type of support service and term of such service (if any), the Fees charged, taxes applicable, the license key(s) (depending on which Software You are licensing) to activate the Software, and any other terms specific to the Software in question (“<strong>License Certificate</strong>”).

<p><font size="2"><strong>TAXES </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2">All Fees are exclusive of any taxes, levies, or duties. You are wholly responsible for any taxes that may arise out of the BULA or Your purchase or use of the Software or any Support Services. If You are required to pay or withhold any tax in respect of any fees due to Us, you shall gross up payments actually made so that We will receive amounts due in full free of any deduction for such tax. To the extent necessary, You shall first coordinate with Us such that a reduced rate under the applicable income tax treaty may be achieved in advance of any payment made to Us. Where so required, You shall also promptly deliver to Us receipts issued by the appropriate government authority and cooperate with Us as other details may be required in connection with Us obtaining a credit in Our home country for such withholding taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, sales tax, goods and services tax (GST) or value-added tax (VAT) may be charged in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. You confirm that We can rely on the “bill to” name and address You have provided at the time of ordering or paying for the Software license and/or Support Services ("<strong>Bill to Name and Address</strong>") as being the place of supply for sales and income tax purposes. Where We are making a supply of services under Article 44 of VAT Directive 2006/112/EC, You confirm that We can rely on the Bill to Name and Address You provided to Us as being the place of supply for VAT purposes. You shall reimburse Us for the amount of any such taxes or duties which We have paid or incurred directly as a result of Our transactions with You, and You agree that We may charge any such reimbursable taxes to any payment method You have used to pay the associated Fees. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>EXPIRY, RESALE AND TERMINATION OF LICENSES </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2">In addition to any other termination provisions set forth herein, You will lose all rights to the Software under this BULA if You: (a) have a Subscription License and have failed to renew Your Subscription License(s) on Expiry; or (b) assign the fully paid Perpetual Licenses in accordance with the above Assignment and Transfer provision (“<strong>Transfer</strong>”) and have no other Subscription License(s) or Perpetual Licenses. You may also lose all rights to the Software under a Perpetual License in accordance with BULA if We offer and You accept to convert Your Perpetual License to a Subscription License (“<strong>Transition</strong>”). Upon such Transition, You must de-install and destroy all copies of the Software You obtained under Your Perpetual Licenses and certify in writing to Us that You have done so. <br />
We also reserve the right to terminate Your license(s) to the Software with immediate effect upon written notice to You (“<strong>Termination</strong>”) if You breach this BULA and such breach: (a) is a material breach; (b) is incapable of being remedied; or (c) is capable of being remedied but remains unremedied for thirty (30) days after Your receipt of written notice of breach from Us. <br />
Upon Expiry, Transfer or Termination, You must promptly: (a) uninstall, discontinue using and destroy all copies of the Software in Your possession or under Your control; (b) return or destroy all documents, license keys and other materials received from Us comprising, bearing, or containing any Confidential Information; and (c) certify to us in writing that You have performed Your obligations under (a) and (b) above.

The Fees chargeable for the Licenses will be on a Per Managed Device basis. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>VIRTUALIZATION ENVIRONMENT [NOT APPLICABLE TO MOTION STUDIO 3D/ WINDVD / ROXIO CREATOR/ ROXIO TOAST/ ROXIO SECURE BURN] </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Subject to the conditions set out under this section You may install the Software on a Virtualization Environment to run, use or access the Software and to allow Users to remotely access and use the Software by means of Your organization's Managed Devices. Your right to install the Software in the foregoing manner is also subject to the Software’s ability to inter operate and function with/on the desired Virtualization Environment. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Use of the Software by Users via such Virtualization Environment is permitted only up to the maximum number of Licenses which You have purchased. You must acquire and dedicate one (1) Subscription License for each Managed Device that is using, running, or accessing the Software through a Virtualization Environment, and one (1) Subscription License for each Managed Device on which the Software is installed. If You have only acquired Perpetual Licenses from Us but wish to use, run or access the Software from a Virtualization Environment, You must first purchase from Us the CorelSure (as defined below) maintenance services, as further set out below, for all Your Perpetual Licenses. Upon such purchase, You must also dedicate one (1) Perpetual License for each Managed Device that is using, running, or accessing the Software through a Virtualization Environment, and one (1) Perpetual License for each Managed Device which the Software is installed on. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Installation on a Virtualization Environment is not permitted in any of the Restricted Jurisdictions (as defined below). Any use of the Software from a Virtualization Environment for which the Software was not designed is entirely at Your own risk and We and Our licensors shall in no way be responsible or liable for any such use or any damage arising therefrom. It is Your responsibility to review the Documentation and any other communications from Us and verify the Software’s suitability for the Virtualization Environment that You are using. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>NAMED USER </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2">A User must use their User Credentials which You have assigned to them to access, run and use the Software and Documentation through a Virtualization Environment. You are responsible at all times for creating, maintaining and protecting the User Credentials and any devices Users use through a Virtualization Environment from all unauthorized use. <br />
You shall also be solely responsible for creating backup files of all data accessed by or used through a Virtualization Environment and You further agree that We are not liable for any damages relating to lost, corrupted, or damaged data. <br />

Should You or any of Your Users access, run or use Software on two or more Managed Devices simultaneously, the Software may disable the access from all Managed Devices.<br />
</font><font size="2">You shall not allow any User Credential to be used by or assigned to more than one individual User. You may reassign a User Credential in its entirety to another individual User, in which case the prior User shall no longer have any right to access or use the Software and/or Documentation. If You have purchased multiple Licenses for use by You and/or Your Users, You may without prejudice to mandatory local copyright law reassign a User Credential under a License from one User to another User, only if<br />
</font><font size="2">(a) the original User’s relationship with You has been terminated; or <br />
  (b) the original User’ s relationship with You has been transferred to a non-licensed department within Your legal entity. <br />
We can suspend Your and Your Users’ access to the Software and Documentation if, in Our sole discretion, We believe that (a) there is risk to the security or privacy of any account (or to the security or privacy of another customer's account); (b) there is a threat to the security or integrity of Our network or the Software; or (c) such a suspension is needed to protect the rights, property, or safety of Us, Our users, or the public, or is required by law. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>ACADEMIC VERSION </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2">If You have a license to use a version of the Software that is labelled as an academic, home and student, student and teacher or education edition in the accompanying Documentation in the packaging and/or in the purchase or download page of the Website as available in the jurisdiction where You are located (“<strong>Academic Version</strong>”) and You are a Business Customer that is a Qualified Institute, You may install and download the Academic Version in accordance with the license metrics specified in Your License Certificate. A “<strong>Qualified Institute</strong>” means a public or private accredited organization located at a single address whose primary purpose is to provide educational instruction, including services which are rendered in conjunction with such purpose and which is designated by Us as a Qualified Institute. The institution must be a preschool, primary school, secondary school, vocational school, correspondence school, junior college, college, higher education college, polytechnic, university or scientific or technical institute accredited by associations recognized by their relevant ministry or department of education. Qualified Institute includes institutions which are either supervisory or organizations of any entity meeting the qualifications set out above, such as, departments of education, boards of education, local education authorities, ministries of education, and school district administrative officials, or hospitals which are wholly owned or affiliated to an educational institution. Contact Us via Our Academic Software web page (www.corel.com/education/) or Your local reseller to determine whether You are a Qualified Institute and to learn more about Our academic programs and products. If a question arises as to whether You are a Qualified Institute, Our determination shall prevail. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">A Site License might be available to a Qualified Institute for an Academic Version in the jurisdiction where the Qualified Institute is located. By “<strong>Site License</strong>” We mean a Subscription License that entitles You to allow an unspecified number of Academic Users to access and use the Software through Your Virtualization Environment, on and from multiple devices at different instances of time and from any location. Under a Site License You may also allow each Academic User to install a copy of the Academic Version on no more than one device provided that such installation does not occur in any of the Restricted Jurisdictions. You shall ensure that no Academic User may access, run and/or use the Software from or on two or more devices simultaneously at any given time. Should You or any of Your Academic Users access, run or use Software on two or more devices simultaneously, the Software may disable the access from all devices. For the purposes of the foregoing provisions an “Academic User” means a User who is a student who is enrolled with the Qualified Institute or a staff member, faculty member, instructor, teacher, director, who is under employment, supervision or direction of the Qualified Institute. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Academic Versions of the Software may not be used for commercial or other for-profit purposes. You are not entitled to use an Academic Version of the Software unless Your Users are faculty, staff member or degree, diploma, or certificate-seeking students and You are qualified educational institutions. Contact Us via Our Academic Software web page (www.corel.com/education/) or Your local reseller to determine whether You qualify as an academic Business Customer and to learn more about Our academic programs and products. An Academic Version may include work products and other data which may contain certain notices and limitations that make the data unusable outside the educational use area (“<strong>Work Product</strong>”). If You or any Users combine or link data which You or any of Your Users create with Academic Versions of the Software with any Work Product, then that data may also be affected by these notices and limitations. Fees for a Site License may vary according to jurisdiction and may be chargeable on the basis of different bands of numbers of Academic Users or number of full-time employees of a Qualified Institute. </font></p>

If the WM-DRM Software's security has been compromised, owners of Secure Content ("<strong>Secure Content Owners</strong>") may request that Microsoft revoke the WM-DRM Software's right to copy, display and/or play Secure Content. Revocation does not alter the WM-DRM Software's ability to play unprotected content.

WM-DRM features that access the Internet, such as acquiring new licenses and/or performing a required WM-DRM Upgrade, can be switched off. When these features are switched off, You will still be able to play Secure Content if You have a valid license for such content already stored on Your computer. </font></p>
